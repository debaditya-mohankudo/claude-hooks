"""concept__* MCP tools (task:2813ece5) — thin wrappers around
concept_store/store.py's ConceptStore (JSON format), for Claude to read/
write architectural concepts inline during a session in a NON-Java repo.

Java/Spring repos are owned end-to-end by SeniorDevAgent's own Path 1/2/3
pipeline (a batch process) and use a SQLite-format concepts.db — explicitly
out of scope here. This is for the interactive, in-session read/write case
against a target repo's concept_store/concepts.json.

`repo` is REQUIRED on every tool (unlike code_rag.py's _resolve_repo, which
defaults to claude-hooks itself) — there is no sensible default target repo
for a tool whose whole purpose is operating on repos other than this one.
